# All plugins from SoloWanna

Current plugins:
- Raid Player Names (Puts the names of people you raid with in the sidebar)
- Copy friends/chat names (Gives the user the option to copy all players from a FC or CC)
- Auto Kick (Gives the users the ability to auto kick players when they join (This doesnt work well with the Confirm Kick option))
